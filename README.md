== Built @ Flatiron School

Built is a CMS designed to store and share galleries of open-source software projects. 

Programmers don’t have an easy way to share their work visually. We created Built to showcase Flatiron School students’ work in a portfolio-like presentation. 

Check out our live site: http://built.flatironschool.com.

== How to Submit and Showcase a Project

If you are a current or former Flatiron School student, you can submit your projects on the Built site by signing up for the site with your Github account.

== Key Components

Built uses Ruby on Rails.

All information for any given Github repository, including its name, contributors, contributor gravatars, and star and fork counts, are retrieved using the Github API.

Built uses: 
1) Octokit, a GitHub API wrapper, to interact with the Github API.   
2) Paperclip gem to upload images.  
3) Omniauth for authentication.  
4) Twitter Bootstrap for front end pretty-ness.
